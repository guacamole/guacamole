### Journey begins
Hi ya'll I have recently started learning programming. Facinated by the way things work in tech, I really wanted to be a part of open source comminuty.   Not to thank but this Pendamic/lockdown really gave me a chance to push my limits and come out of the shell and do some shell hahaha. I am basically a Network Engineer and i am **Bored** of my current job.  My goal is to break the boardom and make it _Beautiful_.
I'm only wandering around and learning whatever i stumble upon but my basic plan for now is to learn the following
* Go
* AWS Services
* Ansible
* Markdown, _well i've already started on this_
* Distributed Systems
* Linux 
* PostgreSQL

> I'm also a Fashion Designer and have my way around knitting/crochet, check out my knitted Ted <br/>

### Hello There!
My name is Gunjan aka Guacamole and I am a Software Engineer. I started my career in networking (2015) and slowly made my way into tech and development. My first project was during the networking job where I automated firmware upgrade of HP Aruba Switches. Before automation the process took several days of manual work to check and update over 1000 switches across the orgnisation by multiple teammates. After automation it took a few hours after you fill in the IPs of switches

### Hello There!
My name is Gunjan aka Guacamole and I am a software Engineer. I started my career in networking and slowly made my way into tech and development. As I began to learn and work with various things like:
* Go
* AWS Services
* Ansible
* Distributed Systems
* Linux 
* PostgreSQL

I realised I am good with frontends and design and so I have been persuing the same path ever since.
My current stack is: 

* Figma
* Procreate
* Svelte, Sveltekit
* TypeScript
* Learning Animations with GSAP

It has been a long journey and I have a long way to go. I am passionate about design and I Love what I do.

> I'm also into Merch Designing and have my way around knitting/crochet, check out my knitted Ted <br/>
